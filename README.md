# Reinforcement-Learning
The performance of a relatively new reinforcement learning algorithm, QV-Learning, is compared with that of two popular ones, Q-Learning and SARSA, via experiment simulations.

experiment.py is a driver class that creates instances of the three learning agents and reports the average reward values they've rendered over a fixed amount of experiment rounds.

# The project is currently in progress, with commented suggestions of thoughts and debated options.
